# Image-encryption-and-decryption-using-Rubik-s-cube-algorithm

In this world full of cyber threats and security breaches there is always a fear of losing the
data to hackers and other unauthorized people who try to breach security, break
confidentiality and steal data from the drives, images and messages we send. That’s why
it’s important to have a good enough encryption algorithm in order to encrypt the image
while sending from one system to another system or from source to destination.



This is a novel image encryption algorithm based on Rubik's cube principle. The original
image is scrambled using the principle of Rubik's cube. Then, XOR operator is applied to
rows and columns of the scrambled image using two secret keys.
We can even give the number of iteration to be performed to shuffle the rgb pixel vectors are scrambled and saved in the row vector and column vector.


Image encryption can be defined as the process of encoding the original image with the help 
of some encryption algorithm in such a way that unauthorized users can't access it. In this 
project we are implementing a chaos based image encryption algorithm - “Rubik’s cube 
algorithm”. From experimental analysis it is demonstrated that the image encryption 
algorithm has the advantage of large key space and high-level security, high obscure level 
and high speed. This algorithm has increased the confidentiality and security from 
unauthorized access.
